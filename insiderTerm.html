                <li><strong>EARNING REWARDS POINTS THROUGH QUALIFYING ACTIVITIES; CONVERSION OF REDEEMABLE REWARDS POINTS INTO REWARDS</strong>The Program includes two elements: Rewards Points and Rewards. “Rewards Points” are defined, collectively, as the following three categories of points:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>“Redeemable Rewards Points”: points accumulated through the completion of various Qualifying Activities (defined below) that are then redeemable for digital and/or physical rewards that are offered by Marvel to Marvel Insiders from time to time as part of the Program ("Rewards"). The number of Redeemable Rewards Points decreases with each reward you redeem. Redeemable Rewards Points balance carries over from year to year.</li>
                        <li>“Lifetime Rewards Points”: the total number of Redeemable Rewards Points accumulated by a Marvel Insider during the lifetime of the Marvel Insider’s participation in the Program (whether or not such Redeemable Rewards Points have been redeemed for Rewards).</li>
                        <li>“Fan Level Points”: points accumulated through the completion of various Qualifying Activities that are then used to calculate the applicable Membership Level (defined below)</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Earning Rewards Points. "Rewards Points" will be earned for performing the qualifying activities designated by Marvel as part of the Program (such as, for example: by registering for the Program; by engaging in certain specified activities such as visiting or watching videos; by engaging in certain specified activities related to social networks; by checking in at a movie theater et al.) (each a "Qualifying Activity").  Rewards Points will appear in your Program following (usually within forty-eight (48) hours) completion of a Qualifying Activity. The conduct that constitutes a Qualifying Activity and/or the number of Rewards Points earned for such Qualifying Activity may be changed by Marvel from time to time, in its sole discretion. Also, Marvel may offer Rewards Points for engaging in a Qualifying Activity under one set of rules for one promotion, and may opt not to offer Rewards Points for engaging in that same activity under a subsequent or previous promotion. The current schedule of Qualifying Activities and the number of Rewards Points that may be earned for performing each is available HERE.You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Marvel's ability to accurately credit Rewards Points to your account based on your activities at third party sites, apps, locations, et al. (e.g., social networking sites) may be restricted by such third party’s terms, conditions or functions; (ii) Rewards Points are not valid unless earned in strict compliance with the requirements set forth by Marvel, and you shall not attempt to earn Points by any means (including without limitation, by using any script, bot or other automated means) that only simulates compliance with the applicable requirements; and (iii) Marvel's good faith determination of the amount of Rewards Points available to any Marvel Insider hereunder shall be final and binding.Any Rewards Points you earn are considered a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and non-transferable right solely for: (i) use towards the earning of Rewards and/or (ii) attaining a Membership Level (defined below), in accordance with these Insider Rewards Terms. Accordingly, you have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, or monetary interest in your Rewards Points, which remain Marvel property at all times. Rewards Points do not have any monetary or cash value and they may not be redeemed with us or any third party for cash or any cash equivalent except under the Program. Rewards Points are not transferable and cannot be combined with other offers or with another Marvel Insider's Rewards Points or Rewards.

Redeemable Rewards Points subsequently determined, in the sole discretion of Marvel, to be invalid, will be removed from a Marvel Insider's Rewards Point accumulation total.
                    Marvel may revoke your ability to participate in the Program due to: (i) your abuse of the Program, including, without limitation, your use of any  automated means to participate in the Program or to earn Redeemable Rewards Points; (ii) your failure to follow the Insider Rewards Terms, the Marvel.com Terms of Use, the Marvel Digital Comics License Agreement, the Marvel Unlimited Subscriber Agreement, and any other terms and conditions applicable to the Program; (iii) the attempted or actual sale of any of your Redeemable Rewards Points, Rewards, or your Program account; (iv) any misrepresentation by you; (v) suspension or termination of your Program account; (vi) any suspected illegal or fraudulent activity; (vii) any violation of the Marvel Insider Conduct and Rules set forth above or (viii) any other conduct deemed by Marvel, in its sole discretion, to be an abuse of the Program, to be detrimental to the interests of Marvel, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensees, suppliers, or its customers, or to be otherwise improper.

                    Terminating Your Program Participation.  If at any time you no longer wish to participate in the Program, you may terminate your Program account by reaching out to Marvel Customer Support at help.marvel.com. Note that terminating your Program account will not affect your Marvel.com Account or access to any entitlements (e.g., digital comics, Marvel Unlimited) that may be associated with that account.
                    Further, since having a Marvel.com Account is a requirement in order to participate in the Program, termination of your Marvel.com Account (either by you or by Marvel) will result in the automatic termination of your participation in the Program. Termination of your Marvel.com Account (either by you or by Marvel) will result in the forfeiture of any Redeemable Rewards Points and Rewards then associated with your Program account. If you later elect to reenroll in Marvel Insider, you will have access to the Redeemable Rewards Points and/or Rewards previously associated with your Program account provided that you:  (1) reenroll using the same email address previously associated with your Program account; and (2) in the case of Redeemable Rewards Points, reenroll before your Redeemable Rewards Points expire (as set forth in Expiration of Redeemable Rewards Points).  If you do not reenroll in accordance with the foregoing (i) and (ii), your beginning balance of Redeemable Rewards Points will be zero and you may not have access to certain Rewards previously associated with your Program account.</li>
                <li><strong>MODIFICATION, SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF PROGRAM</strong>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion and at any time, without prior notice, to modify, suspend or terminate any or all aspects of the Program, including, without limitation: (i) the ability to earn and redeem Redeemable Rewards Points and the number of Redeemable Rewards Points earned through Qualifying Activities or promotions, (ii) offer additional or new Qualifying Activities for a limited time or permanently, (iii) limit the number of times or frequency a Marvel Insider may earn Redeemable Rewards Points for engaging in a Qualifying Activity or engaging in the activity during a specific time period, (iv) offer Redeemable Rewards Points earning opportunities to select groups of Marvel Insiders, (v) redemption and conversion requirements, (vi) Reward values and amounts, (vii) for the available Rewards, (viii) the mechanism for redeeming Rewards, and (ix) the Insider Rewards Terms.
                    Any Redeemable Rewards Points remaining in your Program account thirty (30) days after the Program stops operating will be forfeited without compensation. Marvel makes no guarantee or representation as to the length of time during which the Program will be offered, and the Program could end at any time. Marvel Insiders will have thirty (30) days after the Program end date (or the specific number of days noted in the Program ending announcement) during which to redeem any remaining Redeemable Rewards Points in your Program account. After such thirty (30) day period, all Redeemable Rewards Points will expire and the Program will no longer be available, and no further liability will be owed by us to any Marvel Insider.</li>
                <li><strong>DISPUTES</strong>All questions or disputes regarding eligibility for the Program, collecting or redemption of Redeemable Rewards Points or Rewards, or your compliance with the Insider Rewards Terms will be resolved by Marvel, in its sole and absolute discretion.
